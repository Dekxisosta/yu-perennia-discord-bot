## Author's Note
I will move to making other projects for now. By the time I'm writing this section, I realized I have no need for a personalized discord bot yet.
However, if the need arises or a number of people have pushed for such bot to function, then I will work on this project again

## Description
A modular and scalable Discord bot framework built with Python and discord.py.
Designed for easy extension with commands and events, centralized logging, and a clean project structure.
Currently in early development; some package structure and features may change as the project evolves.

## Discord Bot Features

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **General Commands** | Provides simple utility commands for everyday server tasks, fun interactions, and informational queries. Designed to be easy-to-use for both developers and users. Includes UI/UX components for an interactive experience, like buttons, menus, and embedded responses. |
| **Moderation Commands** | Core moderation features that are actively being developed and improved, including member management, permission checks, and automated enforcement tools. Comes with UI/UX components to streamline interactions, confirmations, and status displays. |

## Source Code Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Dynamic Autoloader** | Automatically discovers and loads commands, events, and modules from your project folders. Adding new features is as simple as creating a file—no need to touch core bot code. Ideal for modular development and fast iteration. |
| **Centralized Logging** | Important bot actions—like startup events, module loads, and command execution—appear in the console for immediate visibility. Full activity logs, including Discord internal logs, are saved to a file for detailed debugging, monitoring, and auditing. |
| **Configurable Settings** | Easily adjust command prefixes, intents, tokens, and logging behavior through the config folder. Supports multiple environments, so you can switch settings with minimal changes. |
| **Reusable Utilities** | Comes with helper modules for logging, autoloading, permissions tracking, message sending, and other common tasks. These utilities make building new features or integrating external APIs faster and cleaner. |
| **Persistent User Data** | Stores user-related information in **SQLite**, enabling commands and events to read/write persistent data efficiently, without requiring an external database server. |
